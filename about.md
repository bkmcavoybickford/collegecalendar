title: About this site
---

The purpose of this site is:

* To gather all of the important information about the college quizbowl season on a simple, easily-referenced central landing page.
* To establish the perception of a standard season calendar, at least until a more formal scheduling process arises in the future.

This site is intended to replace teams having to search the forums each month to find out what events are happening, and tournament directors having to send out mail to advertise their events. In other words, if someone wants to get involved in college quizbowl, you can simply point them to this page and say, “being a quizbowl team means going to all these tournaments in your region, up to your maximum comfortable difficulty.”

This site was started in March 2018 by Ophir Lifshitz and entrusted to the community upon launch in June 2018. Special thanks to all my Patreon supporters and volunteers.
